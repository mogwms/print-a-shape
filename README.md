# Project Reflection
Week 2 - Project 2

Learned calling different Java methods, such as System.out.println(), as well as experimenting with basic functions for organizational purposes.

# Pseudocode

```
START
  FUNCTION createSquare()
    FOR I FROM 1 TO 3
       PRINT (SQUARE DRAWING)
    ENDFOR
  END FUNCTION

  FUNCTION createTriangle()
    PRINT (TRIANGLE DRAWING)
  END FUNCTION

  FUNCTION createCircle()
    PRINT (CIRCLE DRAWING)
  END FUNCTION

  FUNCTION createRectangle()
    PRINT (RECTANGLE DRAWING)
  END FUNCTION

  createSquare()
  createTriangle()
  createCircle()
  createRectangle()
END
```
