# Project Reflection
Week 2 - Project 2

Learned calling different Java methods, such as System.out.println(), as well as experimenting with basic functions for organizational purposes.

# Pseudocode

```
START
  FUNCTION createSquare()
    FOR I FROM 1 TO 3
       PRINT (SQUARE DRAWING)
    ENDFOR
  END FUNCTIONS

  FUNCTION createTriangle()
    PRINT (TRIANGLE DRAWING)
  END FUNCTIONS

  FUNCTION createCircle()
    PRINT (CIRCLE DRAWING)
  END FUNCTIONS

  FUNCTION createRectangle()
    PRINT (RECTANGLE DRAWING)
  END FUNCTIONS

  createSquare()
  createTriangle()
  createCircle()
  createRectangle()
END
```
